# Portfolio

## Inspiration
- [Web Developer Reacts to Beautiful Portfolio Websites](https://youtu.be/KWVJTRWILjU)
- Color palette and Design Inspiration: [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)
## Family Tree
- The Data for family tree is collected with the help of my dad nilkanth chaudhari and uncle bhaskar chaudhari also thanks to other family member who helped on whatsapp group.
- Only boys are shown in the tree to maintain consistency with historical source which had only boys data.  
## Todo
- `Safari` not supported due to testing limitation, add support or suggest user to use another browser.

- Code enhancement:
  1. Migrate to `Typescript`
  2. `Eslint` and `prettier` setup with typescript
  3. `Husky` for pre-commit hook to lint and format code

- Upgrade `d3` to version 7 and split d3 imports to sub libraries.
- Use `styled components` instead of cluttering everything in single `.scss` file.
