# [Portfolio - LiveðŸŸ¢](https://ketan-10.github.io/portfolio/)

## Inspiration
- [Web Developer Reacts to Beautiful Portfolio Websites](https://youtu.be/KWVJTRWILjU)
- Color palette and Design Inspiration: [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/)
## Family Tree
- The Data for family tree is collected with the help of my dad nilkanth chaudhari and uncle bhaskar chaudhari also thanks to other family member who helped on whatsapp group.
- Only boys are shown in the tree to maintain consistency with historical source which had only boys data.  
## Todo
- `Safari` not supported due to testing limitation, add support or suggest user to use another browser.

- Code enhancement:
  1. Migrate to `Typescript`
  2. `Eslint` and `prettier` setup with typescript
  3. `Husky` for pre-commit hook to lint and format code

- Upgrade `d3` to version 7 and split d3 imports to sub libraries.
- Use `styled components` instead of cluttering everything in single `.scss` file.
- Add `react-helmet` for SEO and meta-data

# Github - Pages 
- ketan-10.github.io is connected to ketan.link 
- Note: As before this repo-name was 'portfolio' -> so The URL given by github pages was ketan-10.github.io/portfolio
- So to keep the backward compatibility, I added the folder 'portfolio' in public directory with index.html routing to homepage.
- Note If I in future create another repo called 'portfolio' and add gh-pages. the url '/portfolio' will be redirected to new repo. *Not the folder named portfolio in This repo*.
